# Prediction Stock Monthly Returns Using Basic Machine Learning Models

Update date: Nov 2025

This is project for Rutgers Business School course "Machine Learning in Finance", taught by [Prof. Serdar Dinc](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/faculty/serdar-dinc)

Project aims to predict monthly stock returns using basic machine learning models such as:

- Elastic Net Regression
- Gradient Boosting Trees
- Neural Networks

Then by categorizing the features into economic meaningful groups, by remove one group at a time and observe the performance change, we can identify the most important feature groups that drive stock returns. The groups examples include:

- Size and Value
- Momentum
- Peer Stock Performance
- ... and more

The data used in this project is provided by Prof. Dinc, using the [openap dataset](https://www.openassetpricing.com/data/), the stock universe includes all stocks CRSP.
